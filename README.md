# Sophie Bot

Imagine this: A pedophile just slipped inside your teen dating server and none of your moderators noticed. They chat it up with some kids and eventually get one into DMs. That kid is now missing or has been assaulted by that pedophile. Now hit the rewind button because now Sophie exists. Sophie will scan the server for known pedophiles as well as attempt to detect potentional pedophilic actvity by looking for keywords. If something is found, it'll alert your moderators to the unusual activity. Your server will be pedophile free and you can rest easy.

### Notice
Sophie will NOT be coming to Twitter! We applied for use of Twitter's API (required to make the bot) and they banned us from using the API. Because of this, we will not only not be supporting Twitter with our bot (mostly because we can't) we also won't be supporting Twitter as a platform, since they know there is a problem with pedophilia on their platform and they won't even let someone else help fix it, put aside fixing it themselves. We are working on using the Reddit API.
