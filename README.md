# Sophie Bot

Imagine this: A pedophile just slipped inside your teen dating server and none of your moderators noticed. They chat it up with some kids and eventually get one into DMs. That kid is now missing or has been assaulted by that pedophile. Now hit the rewind button because now Sophie exists. Sophie will scan the server for known pedophiles as well as attempt to detect potentional pedophilic actvity by looking for keywords. If something is found, it'll alert your moderators to the unusual activity. Your server will be pedophile free and you can rest easy.

## Update Information
Sophie is going to go under a massive re-development over the next few days. We will be programming an entire Sophie Core, recoding the API, and creating an AI that can help detect speech patterns of a pedophile. Because of this, this repo will have a lot of activity. If you want a more stable version, please refer to the Stable branch.

### Notice
Sophie will NOT be coming to Twitter! We have applied for their API and were denied, and we intend to respect their wishes to not allow Sophie on their platform.
