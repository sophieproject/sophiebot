# KidSafe
A Discord bot that protects children from predators online


TODO:
Setup the MySQL and add all users that match the first list (minors) to a database, their Discord ID being the indentifier and unique and their messsage (I am blank years old) logged, then IF statements to verify an adult is talking to a minor (and a repeat of the array and included code) to then throw the red flag. We'll add the sexual cues later. (Just listing what needs to be done before it can be considered a prototype)
